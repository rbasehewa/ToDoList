// AWS

// what is Cloud computing? anytthing that delivering hosted services over the internet. (servers/ database, storage/ networking/ sofware)

// Services (Infrastrcture as a service/ Platofrma as a serivce/ software as a service)

// what are the primary serivces AWS (EC2/ S3/ cloud front/ lamda / VPS) --- cloud/ storage/ serverless technology--- they have more than 200 services

// S3 - storage service/ you can store unlimited data in s3 bucket / pricing SPECIALLY (if you have frequently using like images AWS charging more but like bankl statment AWS charging very less amount)

// cloudfront - stored S3 not like S3 bucket, ex: NETFLIX



// Design pattern

// commonly occuring problams in software design, it is not a temnplate or code, it is templkate or description how to solve problas in many diffferent problams

// creationals/ structural/ behavioral

// creationals -> factory/abstract/ singleton

// *** singleton - ensure one instant of object is created, for one class ex: hardware (printer) , configration for your project

// Structurals -> classes or objects into large scales

// Behavioural - > objects to objects communications
